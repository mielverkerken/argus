The license templates in this directory can be copied and modified
to generate license files that are specific to a particular machine.
Licenses for appliance systems are "uncounted", meaning that the resulting
license can be checked out any number of times - it need only be present
for a /usr/sbin/argus process to run.  Licenses for workstation builds
to be used on specific machines are also uncounted.

Counted licenses are used with the flexera+qosient license server and
are checked out as floating licenses.

These licenses are specific to a major release of ArgusPro.
