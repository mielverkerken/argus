We've modified the process quite a bit for Catalina to be able to get the argus pkg notarized.
Now were using argus-osx to build an argus app that has the right entitlements in order to
get a pkg that has the right stuff, so to speak.

So build with Xcode in the argus-osx directory.
install the binary that is generated to /usr/local/sbin for testing.
This is found in /Users/carter/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/argus-*/Build/Products/Debug
The run from the argus directory:
   make OSXSIGN='--sign "Developer ID Installer"' osxpackage

And we should end up with a signed pkg, with a properly signed argus app.
