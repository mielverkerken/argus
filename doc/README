Man page conversion to pdf's is done with the shell script below, using 
Ghostscript's ps2pdf on Linux and pstopdf on Mac OS X.  Both use 
"man -t" to generates postscript output.  This maybe the case on all
Unix's but not sure about that.

for i in man/*/*; \
do echo $i; \
   man -t $i | ps2pdf - `echo $i | sed -e "s/man/doc\/pdf\/man/"`.pdf; \
done

For Mac OS X, use pstopdf.

for i in man/*/*; \
do echo $i; \
   man -t $i | pstopdf -i -o `echo $i | sed -e "s/man/doc\/pdf\/man/"`.pdf; \
done
