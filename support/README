The files in these directories are sample configuration, system startup
scripts, filters, etc... to support the use of argus and its clients.
These files are simple examples, and may need to be modified to support
your specific system.  These files have been tested primarily on Linux.

Archive
   argusarchive - An sh shell script for moving the argus daemon's output
                  file into a date based archive.  The archive file
                  system is created when needed and the output file
                  is compressed and moved into the file system.

Config
       excel.rc - Excel.rc is a ra configuration file to write output so 
                  that it can be imported by Microsoft's Excel.
                  Basically generates a comma-separated-file (csv)
                  with appropriate titles for the columns and a
                  date format that Excel understands.

    fmodel.conf - A sample flow aggregation configuration for ragator().


Deployment
         sample - This is a description of a tradtional argus probe
                  deployment strategy.  Describes placement on an
                  ethernet DMZ and interface configurations that address
                  issues that you may find important.

Startup
          argus - This is a system boot startup script that does a very
                  nice job.
