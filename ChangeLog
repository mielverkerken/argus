This is the public release of Argus Pro Software, and represents 4 years of development.
Argus-5.0 is developed using github.com, and the history of the software, starting from
Argus 3.0.4, is held in the repositories history.

The primary changes in argus-5.0 include:
   1. Zero configuration for argus deployments.
      Assigning unique source id's in large scale deployments has been a burden for some.
      In argus-5.0, we support using the 128-bit hostuuid, or machine-id, as the argus source id.
      Also, to improve detection of key security issues, we added the ability to extend the source
      id with the 32-bit name of the interface monitored by argus.

      These 2 simple changes cause the increase in major version number, as
      the new data format is incompatible with argus-3.0 data, as it expects a 32-bit srcid.

   2. Endpoint argus monitor support.
      A primary design consideration was to run argus on laptops, workstations and tablets.
      These endpoint systems generally have less resources, memory, and dynamic numbers
      of interfaces to monitor.

   3. Performance enhancements.
      To ensure usability in endpoints, and also to support contemporary network
      performance levels, the core argus sensor in this release is improved for speed.

   4. Improve feature extraction.
      Argus has a dense amount of information in each record.  Argus-5.0 expands
      on this by adding behavioral features, packet dynamics metrics, and improved
      payload capture.  Argus has always supported partial payload capture in each flow
      record.  In order to offer more detailed features and forensics support, argus-5.0
      provides configurable full packet capture for protocols and ports of interest.
      By default this mechanism will capture all control plane contents, and non IP traffic
      contents.  Use this to support a complete passive DNS capability, ie capture all the
      DNS traffic the sensor sees.

   5. Bug fixes.
      The number of bug fixes is too large to enumerate, but the git history
      has indications of the types of bugs fixed.
